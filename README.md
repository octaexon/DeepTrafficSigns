### Prologue

Welcome to DeepTrafficSigns: a peek into real-time road sign assistance.

In the 1st quarter of 2018, I participated in an intensive data science program in Berlin: [Data
Science Retreat](https://www.datascienceretreat.com).  In the latter stages, we were tasked with
developing a *portfolio project* to showcase some of the skills we had developed over the preceding
months.  My interest in computer vision and deep learning pushed me towards object detection with
neural networks, and road sign assistance held out the promise of an interesting and topical use
case. From the standpoint of autonomous transport, environment comprehension is of utmost importance
and, given the time constraints, road sign detection and recognition seemed feasible in some form.
Ultimately, I was hoping to gain some insight into the topic in general, and to pick up some cool
technical skills along the way.

If this piques you're interest, please don't hesitate to read further. The following pages chart the
development of the project from inception all the way through to [public
presentation](https://www.facebook.com/events/1737172502999930). (Yikes!)
